# GAL -- modern PAL compatible assembler
While writing my [compiler](https://github.com/kala-telo/fishlang),
I wasn't satisfied with existing tooling, such as [MACRO8X](https://github.com/open-simh/simtools/tree/master/crossassemblers/macro8x),
since it poorly integrates into building process, written in old-style C and is about 4KLOC.</br>
The **GAL** assembler aims to be modern assembler, that is small, easy to use, with readable source code.</br>
Since the assembler is self contained, feel free to just copy `gal.c` into your project.</br>
The `gal.c` is released under MIT license, assembly samples are from varying sources without one explicit license.
